# CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS: This variable is for controlling which IP address
# to listen for incoming connections on. The default value is auto, which will
# set the listen_address option in cassandra.yaml to the IP address of the
# container as it starts. This default should work in most use cases.
CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS="auto"


# CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS: This variable is for controlling which IP
# address to advertise to other nodes. The default value is the value of
# CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS. It will set the broadcast_address and
# broadcast_rpc_address options in cassandra.yaml.
#CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS="<< DISABLED: Allow this default to CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS. >>"


# CASSANDRA_RPC_ADDRESS: This variable is for controlling which address to bind
# the thrift rpc server to. If you do not specify an address, the wildcard
# address (0.0.0.0) will be used. It will set the rpc_address option in
# cassandra.yaml.
#CASSANDRA_RPC_ADDRESS="<< DISABLED: Allow this to default to 0.0.0.0 >>"


# CASSANDRA_START_RPC: This variable is for controlling if the thrift rpc
# server is started. It will set the start_rpc option in cassandra.yaml.
#CASSANDRA_START_RPC=""<< DISABLED: Default is fine for now. >>""


# CASSANDRA_SEEDS: This variable is the comma-separated list of IP addresses
# used by gossip for bootstrapping new nodes joining a cluster. It will set the
# seeds value of the seed_provider option in cassandra.yaml.
# The CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS will be added the the seeds passed in so that
# the server will talk to itself as well.
#CASSANDRA_SEEDS="<< TDB >>"


# CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: This variable sets the name of the cluster and must
# be the same for all nodes in the cluster. It will set the cluster_name
# option of cassandra.yaml.
#CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME="cassandrastack"


# CASSANDRA_NUM_TOKENS: This variable sets number of tokens for this node. It
# will set the num_tokens option of cassandra.yaml.
#CASSANDRA_NUM_TOKENS="<< TDB >>"


# CASSANDRA_DC: This variable sets the datacenter name of this node. It will
# set the dc option of cassandra-rackdc.properties. You must set
# CASSANDRA_ENDPOINT_SNITCH to use the "GossipingPropertyFileSnitch" in order
# for Cassandra to apply cassandra-rackdc.properties, otherwise this variable
# will have no effect.
#CASSANDRA_DC="<< DISABLED: Not currently applicable in this configuration. >>"


# CASSANDRA_RACK: This variable sets the rack name of this node. It will set
# the rack option of cassandra-rackdc.properties. You must set
# CASSANDRA_ENDPOINT_SNITCH to use the "GossipingPropertyFileSnitch" in order
# for Cassandra to apply cassandra-rackdc.properties, otherwise this variable
# will have no effect.
#CASSANDRA_RACK="<< DISABLED: Not currently applicable in this configuration. >>"


# CASSANDRA_ENDPOINT_SNITCH: This variable sets the snitch implementation
# this node will use. It will set the endpoint_snitch option of cassandra.yml.
#CASSANDRA_ENDPOINT_SNITCH="<< TDB >>"
