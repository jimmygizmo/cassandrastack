# todo/ is just random in-progress stuff that's a little too unkempt or irrellevant for the repo.
todo/


# For the following handful of about files, we keep the directory and the about file in place,
# but ignore everything else. It is the about file itself that causes git to store the directory.
# Git will not store an empty directory by itself. All of the following directories we do want to
# be kept in the repository, but we don't want any of their other contents to ever be added to the repo.
# Some of those contents are sensitive and must not be added to any code repository and some of
# those contents are build output, or runtime data which must be kept from polluting the repository accidentally.

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
